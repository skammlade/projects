This is a report on participation in the Horsetooth Time Trial Series from 2011-2015 (data taken from Your Group Ride [google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNnqC5YTzURecVyo8U4a_RAv-KwQoJtCwnjseIOjg1g/pub?output=html))




```{r}
#summary(df)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_chunk('plot.yeargender.HTTT.R')
```


```{r first}
<<plotp>>
 
```

```{r second}
<<p>>
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
