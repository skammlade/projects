Fort Collins, CO is home to a thriving grassroots racing scene. Your Group Ride hosts an annual time trial every Tuesday in April known as the [Horsetooth Time Trial Series](http://yourgroupride.com/index.php/local-races/horsetooth-time-trial-series). The hilly 14.35 mile course runs along Horsetooth Reservoire and Horsetooth Mountain Park climbing a total of 1,336 feet.

I wanted to see how the racer turnout compared between men versus women so I plotted race data from 2011-2015. 2015 was the best turnout for female cyclsts so far with 34 total racers.

```{r}
#summary(df)
```

```{r}
HTTT <- read.table("HTTT.comb.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
HTTT
```


```{r first}
<<plotp>>
 
```

```{r second}
<<p>>
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is a report on participation in the Horsetooth Time Trial Series from 2011-2015 (data taken from Your Group Ride [google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNnqC5YTzURecVyo8U4a_RAv-KwQoJtCwnjseIOjg1g/pub?output=html))
