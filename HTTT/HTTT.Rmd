Fort Collins, CO is home to a thriving grassroots racing scene. Your Group Ride hosts an annual time trial every Tuesday in April known as the [Horsetooth Time Trial Series](http://yourgroupride.com/index.php/local-races/horsetooth-time-trial-series). The hilly **14.35 mile** course runs along Horsetooth Reservoire and Horsetooth Mountain Park climbing a total of **1,336 feet**.

I wanted to see how the racer turnout compared between men versus women so I plotted race data from 2011-2015. Last year had the greatest turnout for female cyclsts so far with **34 racers**.

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('plot.yeargender.HTTT.R')
```

I thought it was a little strange that 2013 had such a low showing. I pulled some temperature data from [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=pws:KCOFORTC71) expecting to see lower temps, but didn't!

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('plot.weather.HTTT.R')
