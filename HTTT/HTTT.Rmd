This is a report on participation in the Horsetooth Time Trial Series from 2011-2015 (data taken from Your Group Ride [google docs][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNnqC5YTzURecVyo8U4a_RAv-KwQoJtCwnjseIOjg1g/pub?output=html])

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
